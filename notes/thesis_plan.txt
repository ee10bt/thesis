CHAPTER ZERO - not my work - what goes in discussion - transfer report
what is the problem/question - why
what do we already know - simulation/mantle divide, each half needs own dedicated section
theory - explain/mention any concepts that will later be refered to

CHAPTER ONE - how do FSE affect the methods? - paper1
temperature fit
how is periclase different
where does model setup go, i.e. potential convergence, getting lammps to work, non-FSE
what do the extrapolations look like, how/why are they different, condition/conductivity

CHAPTER TWO - what do impurities do? - isotopic/iron
how I change the model to do this
temperature/composition fit
do I use this as evidence that direct method requires condition/kappa/MFP-dependent extrapolation? 
have its own, seperate discussion? hey look, depends on composition, as well as temperature!
over-arching MFP/kappa-magnitude dependence, unify temp/comp?
why is this relevant physically? how is this relevant in the context of the mantle?

CHAPTER THREE - how does the mantle behave / LEMA
is the mantle explained in this chapter or ZERO?
interpretation, what are the good fits?
what else is influenced by variable conductivity? - garnero, 2016?
what is my modelling/LEMA lacking, assumptions?

CHAPTER FOUR - discussion/conculsion/future work
need to seperate what others have done and what I have done
block of background or interspersed or discussion?
what studies need to be revisited in light of my findings? - direct method, constant kappa mantle modelling?

each chapter has a results section, compare with other work at end to tie it all together? or compared at each results chapter?

what does future work look like? more pressure/temperatures? LEMA

REFERENCES - where to reference
start off isolated, then move reference/theory/discussion pieces to where they are most relevant. careful balance of previous work in intro/discussion/both
