The use of the direct method leads to diverging thermal conductivity with increasing simulation cell length when cell CSA is kept constant. The problem is not that some cells are too long, it is that the CSA required for non-diverging conductivity increases with length. When cells are short, the requiste CSA is similarily small. For bridgmanite supercells of length 6-16 unit cells, a CSA of 2x2 appears adequate. As the length increases up to 96, even "large" CSAs of 8x8 show divergent behaviour. For 96 length cells CSAs above 8x8 are computationally quite expensive, meaning the range of cell lengths considered needs to be truncated. This isn't a problem as long as cell lengths are longer than the TOO SHORT, BALLISTIC REGIME, but needs to be considered and converged for. The magnitude of divergence increases as kappa/mean free path decreases (temperature increase, impurity concentration[?]).
