Correlation is taken over a longer length than shown on this plot (100 ps), however the function decays to less than 1\% of its initial value at 2~ps.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.5}{\ignorespaces Integrated ACF, multiplied by constants to get thermal conductivity. Large variation in the first 1 ps corresponds to the correlation time where the ACF is unconverged (still decaying / large oscillations). Thermal conductivity is averaged from correlation time of 5~ps - 10~ps (region in red box).\relax }}{13}{figure.caption.51}

Note the sensitivity of the colour scale, showing low conductivities as dominant at high temperatures and intermediate compositions. High values are found only at low temperatures, and even then they rapidly decay and saturate to <8Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. Such conditions are unphysical at 136~GPa within the lower mantle.\relax }}{34}{figure.caption.96}
