abstract = {Bridgmanite (Bdg), iron (Fe)- and aluminum (Al)-bearing magnesium silicate perovskite is the most abundant mineral in the Earth's lower mantle. Thus, its thermal conductivity governs the lower mantle thermal conductivity that critically controls the thermo-chemical evolution of both the core and the lower mantle. While there is extensive research for the lattice thermal conductivity of MgSiO3 Bdg, the effects of Fe and Al incorporation on its lattice thermal conduction are still controversial. Here we report the lattice thermal conductivity of Mg0.832Fe0.209Al0.060Si0.916O3 Bdg measured up to 142 GPa at 300 K using the pulsed light heating thermoreflectance technique in a diamond anvil cell. The results show that the lattice thermal conductivity of Bdg is 25.5±2.2 W/m/K at 135 GPa and 300 K, which is 19{\%} lower than that of Fe and Al-free Bdg at identical conditions. Considering the temperature effect on the lattice conductivity and the contribution of radiative thermal conductivity, the total thermal conductivity of Fe and Al-bearing Bdg does not change very much with temperature at 135 GPa, and could be higher than that of post-perovskite with identical chemical composition.},

@article{Ohta2017,
abstract = {(Mg, Fe)O ferropericlase (Fp) is one of the important minerals comprising Earth's lower mantle, and its thermal conductivity could be strongly influenced by the iron content and its spin state. We examined the lattice thermal conductivity of (Mg, Fe)O Fp containing 19 mol{\%} iron up to 111 GPa and 300 K by means of the pulsed light heating thermoreflectance technique in a diamond anvil cell. We confirmed a strong reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity of Fp due to iron substitution as reported in previous studies. Our results also show that iron spin crossover in Fp reduces its lattice thermal conductivity as well as its radiative conduction. We also measured the electrical conductivity of an identical Fp sample up to 140 GPa and 2730 K, and found that Fp remained an insulator throughout the experimental conditions, indicating the electronic thermal conduction in Fp is negligible. Because of the effects of strong iron impurity scattering and spin crossover, the total thermal conductivity of Fp at the core–mantle boundary conditions is much smaller than that of bridgmanite (Bdg). Our findings indicate that Bdg (and post-perovskite) is the best heat conductor in the Earth's lower mantle, and distribution of iron and its valence state among the lower mantle minerals are key factors to control the lower mantle thermal conductivity.},

abstract = {Thermal conductivity of mantle materials controlling the heat balance and thermal evolution of the Earth remains poorly constrained as the available experimental and theoretical techniques are limited in probing minerals under the relevant conditions. We report measurements of thermal conductivity of MgO at high pressure up to 60 GPa and 300 K via diamond anvil cells using the time-domain thermoreflectance technique. These measurements are complemented by model calculations which take into account the effect of temperature and mass disorder of materials within the Earth. Our model calculations agree with the experimental pressure dependencies at 300 and 2000 K for MgO. Furthermore, they predict substantially smaller pressure dependence for mass disordered materials as the mechanism of scattering changes. The calculated thermal conductivity at the core-mantle boundary is smaller than the majority of previous predictions resulting in an estimated total heat flux of 10.4 TW, which is consistent with modern geomodeling estimates.},

@article{Karki2015,
abstract = {First-principles methods based on density functional theory are used extensively in the investigation of the behavior and properties of mantle materials over broad ranges of pressure, temperature, and composition that are relevant. A review of computational results reported during the last couple of decades shows that essentially all properties including structure, phase transition, equation of state, thermodynamics, elasticity, alloying, conductivity, defects, interfaces, diffusivity, viscosity, and melting have been calculated from first principles. Using MgO, the second most abundant oxide of Earth's mantle, as a primary example and considering many other mantle materials in their crystalline and amorphous phases, we have found that most properties are strongly pressure dependent, sometimes varying non-monotonically and anomalously, with the effects of temperature being systematically suppressed with compression. The overall agreement with the available experimental data is excellent; it is remarkable that the early-calculated results such as shear wave velocities of two key phases, MgO and MgSiO3 perovskite, were subsequently reproduced by experimentation covering almost the entire mantle pressure regime. As covered in some detail, the defect formation and migration enthalpies of key mantle materials increase with pressure. The predicted trend is that partial MgO Schottky defects are energetically most favorable in Mg-silicates but their formation enthalpies are high. So, the diffusion in the mantle is likely to be in the extrinsic regime. Preliminary results on MgO and forsterite hint that the grain boundaries can accommodate point defects (including impurities) and enhance diffusion rates at all pressures. The structures are highly distorted in the close vicinity of the defects and at the interface with excess space. Recent simulations of MgO-SiO2 binary and other silicate melts have found that the melt self-diffusion and viscosity vary by several orders of magnitudes with pressure, temperature, and composition. The predicted high compressibility and complex dynamical behavior can be associated with structural changes (involving non-bridging oxygen, oxygen tri-clusters, Si-O pentahedra, etc.) occurring on compression. We envision future prospect for massively parallel/distributed computing of unprecedented magnitude and scope in the study of relevant materials for Earth, super-Earth, and other planets. A renewed computational theme perhaps should be the first-principles simulations of large systems (with long runs) that are necessary to explore realistic (natural) compositions, polycrystalline phases, multi-component melts, crystal/melt interfaces, trace element partitioning, etc.},

@article{Tosi2013,
abstract = {In numerical simulations of mantle convection it is commonly assumed that the coefficients of thermal expansion $\alpha$ and thermal conduction k are either constant or pressure-dependent. Pressure changes are generally computed using parametrizations that rely on extrapolations of low-pressure data for a single upper-mantle phase. Here we collect data for both the pressure and temperature dependence of $\alpha$ from a database of first-principles calculations, and of k from recent experimental studies. We use these data-sets to construct analytical parametrizations of $\alpha$ and k for the major upper- and lower-mantle phases that can be easily incorporated into exisiting convection codes. We then analyze the impact of such parametrizations on Earth's mantle dynamics by employing two-dimensional numerical models of thermal convection. When $\alpha$ is the only variable parameter, both its temperature and pressure dependence enhance hot plumes and tend to inhibit the descent of cold downwellings. Taking into account a variable k leads to a strong increase of the bulk mantle temperature, which reduces the buoyancy available to amplify bottom boundary layer instabilities and causes mantle flow to be driven primarily by the instability of cold plates whose surface velocity also tends to rise. When both parameters are considered together, we observe an increased propensity to local layering which favors slab stagnation in the transition zone and subsequent thickening in the lower mantle. Furthermore, the values of k near the core-mantle boundary ultimately control the effect of this physical property on convection, which stresses the importance of determining the thermal conductivity of the post-perovskite phase. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The amount of heat flowing from Earth's core critically determines the thermo-chemical evolution of both the core and the lower mantle. Consisting primarily of a polycrystalline aggregate of silicate perovskite and ferropericlase, the thermal boundary layer at the very base of Earth's lower mantle regulates the heat flow from the core, so that the thermal conductivity (k) of these mineral phases controls the amount of heat entering the lowermost mantle. Here we report measurements of the lattice thermal conductivity of pure, Al-, and Fe-bearing MgSiO(3) perovskite at 26 GPa up to 1,073 K, and of ferropericlase containing 0, 5, and 20{\%} Fe, at 8 and 14 GPa up to 1,273 K. We find the incorporation of these elements in silicate perovskite and ferropericlase to result in a ∼50{\%} decrease of lattice thermal conductivity relative to the end member compositions. A model of thermal conductivity constrained from our results indicates that a peridotitic mantle would have k = 9.1 ± 1.2 W/m K at the top of the thermal boundary layer and k = 8.4 ± 1.2 W/m K at its base. These values translate into a heat flux of 11.0 ± 1.4 terawatts (TW) from Earth's core, a range of values consistent with a variety of geophysical estimates.},
