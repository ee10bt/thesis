abstract = {Although aluminium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth's mantle, its effect on the physical properties of perovskite, the main mineral phase in the lower mantle, has largely been ignored. It is becoming clear, however, that many properties of MgSiO3 perovskites are remarkably sensitive to small amounts of aluminium(1-4). In particular, perovskite with only 5 wt{\%} Al2O3 has a bulk modulus 10{\%} lower than that of the pure magnesian end-member(12). The increased compressibility may be due to the high concentrations of oxygen vacancies required to balance the charge of the aluminium 5; if so, this would have important consequences for the mantle, as aluminous perovskites could be weaker, have lower seismic velocities and be hosts for water. To test whether oxygen vacancies exist in aluminous perovskites, I have calculated the compressibility of end-member defect-bearing perovskites using ab initio methods. The results show that perovskites with oxygen vacancies do have significantly greater compressibilities than those without such vacancies. But the results also suggest that oxygen vacancies become unfavourable at high pressures, in which case only the physical properties of the shallow lower mantle would be affected by aluminium-with the deeper mantle retaining properties similar to those of aluminium-free perovskite.},

abstract = {(Mg, Fe)O ferropericlase (Fp) is one of the important minerals comprising Earth's lower mantle, and its thermal conductivity could be strongly influenced by the iron content and its spin state. We examined the lattice thermal conductivity of (Mg, Fe)O Fp containing 19 mol{\%} iron up to 111 GPa and 300 K by means of the pulsed light heating thermoreflectance technique in a diamond anvil cell. We confirmed a strong reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity of Fp due to iron substitution as reported in previous studies. Our results also show that iron spin crossover in Fp reduces its lattice thermal conductivity as well as its radiative conduction. We also measured the electrical conductivity of an identical Fp sample up to 140 GPa and 2730 K, and found that Fp remained an insulator throughout the experimental conditions, indicating the electronic thermal conduction in Fp is negligible. Because of the effects of strong iron impurity scattering and spin crossover, the total thermal conductivity of Fp at the core–mantle boundary conditions is much smaller than that of bridgmanite (Bdg). Our findings indicate that Bdg (and post-perovskite) is the best heat conductor in the Earth's lower mantle, and distribution of iron and its valence state among the lower mantle minerals are key factors to control the lower mantle thermal conductivity.},

abstract = {Bridgmanite (Bdg), iron (Fe)- and aluminum (Al)-bearing magnesium silicate perovskite is the most abundant mineral in the Earth's lower mantle. Thus, its thermal conductivity governs the lower mantle thermal conductivity that critically controls the thermo-chemical evolution of both the core and the lower mantle. While there is extensive research for the lattice thermal conductivity of MgSiO3 Bdg, the effects of Fe and Al incorporation on its lattice thermal conduction are still controversial. Here we report the lattice thermal conductivity of Mg0.832Fe0.209Al0.060Si0.916O3 Bdg measured up to 142 GPa at 300 K using the pulsed light heating thermoreflectance technique in a diamond anvil cell. The results show that the lattice thermal conductivity of Bdg is 25.5±2.2 W/m/K at 135 GPa and 300 K, which is 19{\%} lower than that of Fe and Al-free Bdg at identical conditions. Considering the temperature effect on the lattice conductivity and the contribution of radiative thermal conductivity, the total thermal conductivity of Fe and Al-bearing Bdg does not change very much with temperature at 135 GPa, and could be higher than that of post-perovskite with identical chemical composition.},

@article{Tosi2013,
abstract = {In numerical simulations of mantle convection it is commonly assumed that the coefficients of thermal expansion $\alpha$ and thermal conduction k are either constant or pressure-dependent. Pressure changes are generally computed using parametrizations that rely on extrapolations of low-pressure data for a single upper-mantle phase. Here we collect data for both the pressure and temperature dependence of $\alpha$ from a database of first-principles calculations, and of k from recent experimental studies. We use these data-sets to construct analytical parametrizations of $\alpha$ and k for the major upper- and lower-mantle phases that can be easily incorporated into exisiting convection codes. We then analyze the impact of such parametrizations on Earth's mantle dynamics by employing two-dimensional numerical models of thermal convection. When $\alpha$ is the only variable parameter, both its temperature and pressure dependence enhance hot plumes and tend to inhibit the descent of cold downwellings. Taking into account a variable k leads to a strong increase of the bulk mantle temperature, which reduces the buoyancy available to amplify bottom boundary layer instabilities and causes mantle flow to be driven primarily by the instability of cold plates whose surface velocity also tends to rise. When both parameters are considered together, we observe an increased propensity to local layering which favors slab stagnation in the transition zone and subsequent thickening in the lower mantle. Furthermore, the values of k near the core-mantle boundary ultimately control the effect of this physical property on convection, which stresses the importance of determining the thermal conductivity of the post-perovskite phase. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

At lower-mantle conditions, the peridotite transforms to the assemblage 76 (±2){\%} (Mg0.88Fe0.052+ Fe0.013+Al0.12Si0.94) O3 orthorhombic perovskite by volume (at zero pressure), 17 (±2){\%} (Mg0.80Fe0.20)O magnesiow{\"{u}}stite and 7 (±1){\%} CaSiO3 perovskite. The measured room-temperature bulk properties of this high-pressure assemblage, together with a range of estimates of thermal properties of the constituent minerals, appear to be inconsistent with seismological constraints on the density and bulk modulus of the lower mantle. Our results suggest that the lower mantle differs in bulk composition (e.g., richer in iron, Mg{\#}∼0.85) from current estimates for the upper mantle, requiring some amount of segregation between the upper and lower mantle over geological history. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Karki2015,
abstract = {First-principles methods based on density functional theory are used extensively in the investigation of the behavior and properties of mantle materials over broad ranges of pressure, temperature, and composition that are relevant. A review of computational results reported during the last couple of decades shows that essentially all properties including structure, phase transition, equation of state, thermodynamics, elasticity, alloying, conductivity, defects, interfaces, diffusivity, viscosity, and melting have been calculated from first principles. Using MgO, the second most abundant oxide of Earth's mantle, as a primary example and considering many other mantle materials in their crystalline and amorphous phases, we have found that most properties are strongly pressure dependent, sometimes varying non-monotonically and anomalously, with the effects of temperature being systematically suppressed with compression. The overall agreement with the available experimental data is excellent; it is remarkable that the early-calculated results such as shear wave velocities of two key phases, MgO and MgSiO3 perovskite, were subsequently reproduced by experimentation covering almost the entire mantle pressure regime. As covered in some detail, the defect formation and migration enthalpies of key mantle materials increase with pressure. The predicted trend is that partial MgO Schottky defects are energetically most favorable in Mg-silicates but their formation enthalpies are high. So, the diffusion in the mantle is likely to be in the extrinsic regime. Preliminary results on MgO and forsterite hint that the grain boundaries can accommodate point defects (including impurities) and enhance diffusion rates at all pressures. The structures are highly distorted in the close vicinity of the defects and at the interface with excess space. Recent simulations of MgO-SiO2 binary and other silicate melts have found that the melt self-diffusion and viscosity vary by several orders of magnitudes with pressure, temperature, and composition. The predicted high compressibility and complex dynamical behavior can be associated with structural changes (involving non-bridging oxygen, oxygen tri-clusters, Si-O pentahedra, etc.) occurring on compression. We envision future prospect for massively parallel/distributed computing of unprecedented magnitude and scope in the study of relevant materials for Earth, super-Earth, and other planets. A renewed computational theme perhaps should be the first-principles simulations of large systems (with long runs) that are necessary to explore realistic (natural) compositions, polycrystalline phases, multi-component melts, crystal/melt interfaces, trace element partitioning, etc.},

Using a direct application of the Fourier law, we explore the transition to fully diffusive phonon transport with increasing CNT length. For empty CNTs, we find that the CNT length required to obtain fully diffusive phonon transport decreases from 1090 nm for the 0.83-nm-diameter CNT to 510 nm for the 1.36-nm-diameter CNT. The magnitude of the fully diffusive thermal conductivity also decreases monotonically with increasing CNT diameter. We find that the fully diffusive thermal conductivity of water-filled CNTs is 20{\%}–35{\%} lower than that of empty CNTs. By examining the empty and water-filled CNT density of states, we attribute the thermal conductivity reductions to an increase in low-frequency acoustic phonon scattering due to interactions with the water molecules.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter–atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently — those with short–range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed–memory parallel machine which allows for message–passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard–Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers—the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y–MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840–node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade–offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. This},

abstract = {Temperature gradients in a low-shear-velocity province in the lowermost mantle (D'' region) beneath the central Pacific Ocean were inferred from the observation of a rapid S-wave velocity increase overlying a rapid decrease. These paired seismic discontinuities are attributed to a phase change from perovskite to post-perovskite and then back to perovskite as the temperature increases with depth. Iron enrichment could explain the occurrence of post-perovskite several hundred kilometers above the core-mantle boundary in this warm, chemically distinct province. The double phase-boundary crossing directly constrains the lowermost mantle temperature gradients. Assuming a standard but unconstrained choice of thermal conductivity, the regional core-mantle boundary heat flux (approximately 85 +/- 25 milliwatts per square meter), comparable to the average at Earth's surface, was estimated, along with a lower bound on global core-mantle boundary heat flow in the range of 13 +/- 4 terawatts. Mapped velocity-contrast variations indicate that the lens of post-perovskite minerals thins and vanishes over 1000 kilometers laterally toward the margin of the chemical distinct region as a result of a approximately 500-kelvin temperature increase.},

abstract = {Iron in crustal and mantle minerals adopts several possible oxidation states: this has implications for biogeochemical processes, oxygenation of the atmosphere and the oxidation state of the mantle. In the deep Earth, iron in silicate perovskite, (Mg(0.9)Fe(0.1))SiO(3), and ferropericlase, (Mg(0.85)Fe(0.15))O, influences the thermal conductivity of the lower mantle and therefore heat flux from the core. Little is known, however, about the effect of iron oxidation states on transport properties. Here we show that the radiative component of thermal conductivity in the dominant silicate perovskite material of Earth's lower mantle is controlled by the amount of ferric iron, Fe(3+). We obtained the optical absorption spectra of silicate perovskite and ferropericlase at pressures up to 133 GPa, corresponding to pressures at the core-mantle boundary. Absorption spectra of ferropericlase up to 800 K and 60 GPa exhibit minimal temperature dependence. The results on silicate perovskite show that optical absorption in the visible and near-infrared spectral range is dominated by O-Fe(3+) charge transfer and Fe(3+)-Fe(2+) intervalence transitions, whereas a contribution from the Fe(2+) crystal-field transitions is substantially smaller. The estimated pressure-dependent radiative conductivity, k(rad), from these data is 2-5 times lower than previously inferred from model extrapolations, with implications for the evolution of the mantle, such as generation and stability of thermo-chemical plumes in the lower mantle.},

abstract = {Thermal conductivity of the Earth's lower mantle greatly impacts the mantle convection style and affects the heat conduction from the core to the mantle. Direct laboratory measurement of thermal conductivity of mantle minerals remains a technical challenge at the pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions relevant to the lower mantle, and previously estimated values are extrapolated from low P-T data based on simple empirical thermal transport models. By using a numerical technique that combines first-principles electronic structure theory and Peierls-Boltzmann transport theory, we predict the lattice thermal conductivity of MgO, previously used to estimate the thermal conductivity in the Earth, at conditions from ambient to the core-mantle boundary (CMB). We show that our first-principles technique provides a realistic model for the P-T dependence of lattice thermal conductivity of MgO at conditions from ambient to the CMB, and we propose thermal conductivity profiles of MgO in the lower mantle based on geotherm models. The calculated conductivity increases from 15 -20 W/K-m at the 670 km seismic discontinuity to 40 -50 W/K-m at the CMB. This large depth variation in calculated thermal conductivity should be included in models of mantle convection, which has been traditionally studied based on the assumption of constant conductivity.},

abstract = {A systematic method to calculate anharmonic force constants of crystals is presented. The method employs the direct-method approach, where anharmonic force constants are extracted from the trajectory of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at high temperature. The method is applied to Si where accurate cubic and quartic force constants are obtained. We observe that higher-order correction is crucial to obtain accurate force constants from the trajectory with large atomic displacements. The calculated harmonic and anharmonic force constants are, then, combined with the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods in calculating the thermal conductivity. The BTE approach successfully predicts the lattice thermal conductivity of bulk Si, whereas NEMD shows considerable underestimates. To evaluate the linear extrapolation method employed in NEMD to estimate bulk values, we analyze the size dependence in NEMD based on BTE calculations. We observe strong nonlinearity in the size dependence of NEMD in Si, which can be ascribed to acoustic phonons having long mean-free-paths and carrying considerable heat. Subsequently, we also apply the whole method to a thermoelectric material Mg2Si and demonstrate the reliability of the NEMD method for systems with low thermal conductivities.},

These measurements are complemented by model calculations which take into account the effect of temperature and mass disorder of materials within the Earth. Our model calculations agree with the experimental pressure dependencies at 300 and 2000 K for MgO. Furthermore, they predict substantially smaller pressure dependence for mass disordered materials as the mechanism of scattering changes.

annote = {DIRECT METHOD
































the direct method of calculating thermal conductivity is analogous to experiment
































particle velocities are altered at each time step to change the kinetic energy, energy and thus heat is added to/taken from the system. 
































a quarter of the way along the cell, heat is added, a quarter from the opposite end heat is removed. this sets up a heat current, resulting in a temperature gradient that can be calculated. fourier's law is used alongside this to calculate the thermal conductivity. 
































an error is created, by the drift of the system's centre of mass. local temperature must be defined using velocities obtained in a system with zero centre of mass velocity.
































*ballistic energy currents
































the direct method calculates the thermal conductivity only in the direction of the heat current. for other directions new calculations and experimental cells must be set up.
































the direct method involves large temperature gradients, well outside of the experimental range. it is not immediately obvious that the direct method results will be consistent with experiment. very large temperature gradients may induce non linear effects around the source and sink, such that fourier's law does not apply.
strong non-linear temperature profiles are observed (in this calculation) around 6nm of the source and sink, which is attributed to scattering caused by heating. outside of these regions, temperatures can be fit with a linear profile. two profiles are fit (across the cell and over the boundary) and used to create an error estimate for the thermal conductivity.
































* infinite system extrapolation
an important feature of the simulation cell is the boundaries around the edges of the source and sink. the atomic dynamics in the slabs are altered by the simulation, causing the mean free path to be limited by the size of the system (casimir limit). however, finite size analysis on smaller systems means it is possible to get a good estimate for an infinte system.
































the direct method requires that steady state flow be achieved, a stationary temperature profile as a function of time. only when steady-state currents are flowing can thermal conductivity be calculated from fourier's law. for a limited number of time steps, temperature fluctuations are statistical, but on longer timescales transient effects (relating to the establishment of steady state thermal current) can be observed.
































to check that fourier's law is obeyed and that nonlinear effects are unimportant, it is necessary to check that the computed TC does not depend on the heat of the system. this study found TC to vary with heat, for both extremes. small heats result in large TC error bars, because the magnitude of temperature difference across the cell can be similar to the statistical noise. large values are unsuitable as they create non linear effects. a range of heats are tested, and the one with the smallest error bars are chosen going forwards.
































finite size effects arise when the cell is not significantly longer than the phonon mean free path. this is caused by scattering effects that occur at the interfaces with the source/sink. thermal conductivity is limited by the system size, when the system size is smaller than the mean-free path in an infinite system (casimir).
































*ballistic phono transport / solitonlike modes
































TC does depend on the dimensions to current flow, but not by much. smaller cross-sectional areas produce larger TCs for equivalent current densities. TC from a 2x2xN system compared to a 4x4xN system will be at most 20{\%} larger, and systems larger than 3x3xN agree within error},

@article{Manthilake2011,
abstract = {The amount of heat flowing from Earth's core critically determines the thermo-chemical evolution of both the core and the lower mantle. Consisting primarily of a polycrystalline aggregate of silicate perovskite and ferropericlase, the thermal boundary layer at the very base of Earth's lower mantle regulates the heat flow from the core, so that the thermal conductivity (k) of these mineral phases controls the amount of heat entering the lowermost mantle. Here we report measurements of the lattice thermal conductivity of pure, Al-, and Fe-bearing MgSiO(3) perovskite at 26 GPa up to 1,073 K, and of ferropericlase containing 0, 5, and 20{\%} Fe, at 8 and 14 GPa up to 1,273 K. We find the incorporation of these elements in silicate perovskite and ferropericlase to result in a ∼50{\%} decrease of lattice thermal conductivity relative to the end member compositions. A model of thermal conductivity constrained from our results indicates that a peridotitic mantle would have k = 9.1 ± 1.2 W/m K at the top of the thermal boundary layer and k = 8.4 ± 1.2 W/m K at its base. These values translate into a heat flux of 11.0 ± 1.4 terawatts (TW) from Earth's core, a range of values consistent with a variety of geophysical estimates.},

abstract = {We compare the molecular dynamics Green-Kubo and direct methods for calculating thermal conductivity $\kappa$, using as a test case crystalline silicon at temperatures T in the range 500-1000 K (classical regime). We pay careful attention to the convergence with respect to simulation size and duration and to the procedures used to fit the simulation data. We show that in the Green-Kubo method the heat current autocorrelation function is characterized by three decay processes, of which the slowest lasts several tens of picoseconds so that convergence requires several tens of nanoseconds of data. Using the Stillinger-Weber potential we find excellent agreement between the two methods. We also use the direct method to calculate $\kappa$(T) for the Tersoff potential and find that the magnitude and the temperature-dependence are different for the two potentials and that neither potential agrees with experimental data. We argue that this implies that using the Stillinger-Weber or Tersoff potentials to predict trends in kappa as some system parameter is varied may yield results which are specific to the potential but not intrinsic to Si.},
