abstract = {The Earth's core is a ball of swirling hot metal at the centre of our planet, with a radius roughly one half of the Earth's radius. It is formed by two parts: a solid inner core, with a radius of 1221 km, surrounded by a shell of liquid which extends up to 3480 km from the centre. It is widely believe that the Earth's core is mainly formed by iron, or iron with up to 5-10{\%} of nickel. It is also known that the core must contain a significant fraction of light impurities, in the region of 2-3{\%} in the solid and 6-7{\%} in the liquid. The nature of these light impurities is unknown. The temperature of the core is also inaccessible to direct probing. Here we present a theoretical study on the temperature and the composition of the Earth's core. The investigation is based on the application of the implementation of quantum mechanics known as density functional theory. We shall show that these techniques are very accurate at predicting the properties of iron, and therefore can be usefully used to study the properties of the core. We show that by combining these techniques with direct observations it is possible to predict the temperature of the core, in particular the temperature at the boundary between the solid and the liquid core (the ICB), and put constraints on its composition. The result of this study is that the temperature of the ICB is probably in the region of 5400-5700 K and that the outer core contains a significant fraction (8-13{\%}) of oxygen. As the Earth cools down the solid core grows and expels oxygen in the liquid. Since oxygen is lighter than iron it rises in the liquid, and its gravitational energy is available to drive the convective motions in the liquid core that are responsible for the generation of the Earth's magnetic field.},

The room temperature values of the thermal conductivity in the range approximately (4.84+/-0.44)x10(3) to (5.30+/-0.48)x10(3) W/mK were extracted for a single-layer graphene from the dependence of the Raman G peak frequency on the excitation laser power and independently measured G peak temperature coefficient. The extremely high value of the thermal conductivity suggests that graphene can outperform carbon nanotubes in heat conduction. The superb thermal conduction property of graphene is beneficial for the proposed electronic applications and establishes graphene as an excellent material for thermal management.},

@article{Brodholt2000,
abstract = {Although aluminium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth's mantle, its effect on the physical properties of perovskite, the main mineral phase in the lower mantle, has largely been ignored. It is becoming clear, however, that many properties of MgSiO3 perovskites are remarkably sensitive to small amounts of aluminium(1-4). In particular, perovskite with only 5 wt{\%} Al2O3 has a bulk modulus 10{\%} lower than that of the pure magnesian end-member(12). The increased compressibility may be due to the high concentrations of oxygen vacancies required to balance the charge of the aluminium 5; if so, this would have important consequences for the mantle, as aluminous perovskites could be weaker, have lower seismic velocities and be hosts for water. To test whether oxygen vacancies exist in aluminous perovskites, I have calculated the compressibility of end-member defect-bearing perovskites using ab initio methods. The results show that perovskites with oxygen vacancies do have significantly greater compressibilities than those without such vacancies. But the results also suggest that oxygen vacancies become unfavourable at high pressures, in which case only the physical properties of the shallow lower mantle would be affected by aluminium-with the deeper mantle retaining properties similar to those of aluminium-free perovskite.},

abstract = {Thermal conductivity of mantle materials controlling the heat balance and thermal evolution of the Earth remains poorly constrained as the available experimental and theoretical techniques are limited in probing minerals under the relevant conditions. We report measurements of thermal conductivity of MgO at high pressure up to 60 GPa and 300 K via diamond anvil cells using the time-domain thermoreflectance technique. These measurements are complemented by model calculations which take into account the effect of temperature and mass disorder of materials within the Earth. Our model calculations agree with the experimental pressure dependencies at 300 and 2000 K for MgO. Furthermore, they predict substantially smaller pressure dependence for mass disordered materials as the mechanism of scattering changes. The calculated thermal conductivity at the core-mantle boundary is smaller than the majority of previous predictions resulting in an estimated total heat flux of 10.4 TW, which is consistent with modern geomodeling estimates.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations play an important role in studying heat transport in complex materials. The lattice thermal conductivity can be computed either using the Green-Kubo formula in equilibrium MD (EMD) simulations or using Fourier's law in nonequilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations. These two methods have not been systematically compared for materials with different dimensions and inconsistencies between them have been occasionally reported in the literature. Here we give an in-depth comparison of them in terms of heat transport in three allotropes of Si: three dimensional bulk silicon, two-dimensional silicene, and quasi-one-dimensional silicon nanowire. By multiplying the correlation time in the Green-Kubo formula with an appropriate effective group velocity, we can express the running thermal conductivity in the EMD method as a function of an effective length and directly compare it with the length-dependent thermal conductivity in the NEMD method. We find that the two methods quantitatively agree with each other for all the systems studied, firmly establishing their equivalence in computing thermal conductivity.},

abstract = {Moving core fluid maintains an isothermal core-mantle boundary (CMB), so lateral variations in the CMB heat flow result from mantle convection. Such variations will drive thermal winds, even if the top of the core is stably stratified. These flows may contribute to the magnetic secular variation and are investigated here using a simple, non-magnetic numerical model of the core. The results depend on the equatorial symmetry of the boundary heat flux variation. Large-scale equatorially symmetric (ES) heat flux variations at the outer surface of a rapidly rotating spherical shell drive deeply penetrating flows that are strongly suppressed in stratified fluid. Smaller-scale ES heat flux variations drive flows less dominated by rotation and so less inhibited by stratification. Equatorially anti-symmetric flux variations drive flows an order of magnitude less energetic than those driven by ES patterns but, due to the nature of the Coriolis force, are less suppressed by stratification. The response of the rotating core fluid to a general CMB heat flow pattern will then depend strongly on the subadiabatic temperature profile. Imposing a lateral heat flux variation linearly related to a model of seismic tomography in the lowermost mantle drives flow in a density stratified fluid that reproduces some features found in flows inverted from geomagnetic data.},

abstract = {Iron in crustal and mantle minerals adopts several possible oxidation states: this has implications for biogeochemical processes, oxygenation of the atmosphere and the oxidation state of the mantle. In the deep Earth, iron in silicate perovskite, (Mg(0.9)Fe(0.1))SiO(3), and ferropericlase, (Mg(0.85)Fe(0.15))O, influences the thermal conductivity of the lower mantle and therefore heat flux from the core. Little is known, however, about the effect of iron oxidation states on transport properties. Here we show that the radiative component of thermal conductivity in the dominant silicate perovskite material of Earth's lower mantle is controlled by the amount of ferric iron, Fe(3+). We obtained the optical absorption spectra of silicate perovskite and ferropericlase at pressures up to 133 GPa, corresponding to pressures at the core-mantle boundary. Absorption spectra of ferropericlase up to 800 K and 60 GPa exhibit minimal temperature dependence. The results on silicate perovskite show that optical absorption in the visible and near-infrared spectral range is dominated by O-Fe(3+) charge transfer and Fe(3+)-Fe(2+) intervalence transitions, whereas a contribution from the Fe(2+) crystal-field transitions is substantially smaller. The estimated pressure-dependent radiative conductivity, k(rad), from these data is 2-5 times lower than previously inferred from model extrapolations, with implications for the evolution of the mantle, such as generation and stability of thermo-chemical plumes in the lower mantle.},

abstract = {We compare the molecular dynamics Green-Kubo and direct methods for calculating thermal conductivity $\kappa$, using as a test case crystalline silicon at temperatures T in the range 500-1000 K (classical regime). We pay careful attention to the convergence with respect to simulation size and duration and to the procedures used to fit the simulation data. We show that in the Green-Kubo method the heat current autocorrelation function is characterized by three decay processes, of which the slowest lasts several tens of picoseconds so that convergence requires several tens of nanoseconds of data. Using the Stillinger-Weber potential we find excellent agreement between the two methods. We also use the direct method to calculate $\kappa$(T) for the Tersoff potential and find that the magnitude and the temperature-dependence are different for the two potentials and that neither potential agrees with experimental data. We argue that this implies that using the Stillinger-Weber or Tersoff potentials to predict trends in kappa as some system parameter is varied may yield results which are specific to the potential but not intrinsic to Si.},

abstract = {This paper, seeks to understand through a case study approach social vulnerability and risk perception to natural hazards in Cameroon as a consequence of the Lake Nyos Disaster that occurred in 1986. It is hypothesized that the science-led disaster management nature of the Lake Nyos Disaster that has focused mostly on eliminating the physical risk in the lake have had a serious toll on the lives and livelihood of the disaster survivors. The aim is to unveil the social nature of vulnerability and how risk is viewed based on its perceptions, in order to better appreciate how both risk and vulnerability are affected by disaster management and how they intend influence relocation decisions. This is because though Cameroon is prone to natural hazards, programs for disaster risk management have not established the link between risk, vulnerability and development while risk reduction is still oriented towards technical analyses and structural mitigation measures without any social considerations. The conceptual framework adopts the position that social characteristics that structure people in the society and influence their understanding and interpretation of disasters are determined by the political ecology. The methodological framework adopts a qualitative and quantitative analysis using primary and secondary data. Results show that socioeconomic and demographic factors are responsible for the poverty and low resilience of the survivors thereby making them socially vulnerable. Results also show that risk perception and relocation decisions are guided more by socioeconomic and cultural factors. Apart from giving a new orientation to disaster research in Cameroon, this research, which is still ongoing also aims to brings new insights into factors that exacerbate risk and vulnerability to hazards and disasters within a political ecological framework and also has the potential to inform policy by identifying appropriate means of integrating natural disaster mitigation within the social development process in Cameroon./},

abstract = {Iron may critically influence the physical properties and thermochemical structures of Earth{\&}apos;s lower mantle. Its effects on thermal conductivity, with possible consequences on heat transfer and mantle dynamics, however, remain largely unknown. We measured the lattice thermal conductivity of lower-mantle ferropericlase to 120 GPa using the ultrafast optical pump-probe technique in a diamond anvil cell. The thermal conductivity of ferropericlase with 56{\%} iron significantly drops by a factor of 1.8 across the spin transition around 53 GPa, while that with 8-10{\%} iron increases monotonically with pressure, causing an enhanced iron substitution effect in the low-spin state. Combined with bridgmanite data, modeling of our results provides a self-consistent radial profile of lower-mantle thermal conductivity, which is dominated by pressure, temperature, and iron effects, and shows a twofold increase from top to bottom of the lower mantle. Such increase in thermal conductivity may delay the cooling of the core, while its decrease with iron content may enhance the dynamics of large low shear-wave velocity provinces. Our findings further show that, if hot and strongly enriched in iron, the seismic ultralow velocity zones have exceptionally low conductivity, thus delaying their cooling.},

@article{Karki2015,
abstract = {First-principles methods based on density functional theory are used extensively in the investigation of the behavior and properties of mantle materials over broad ranges of pressure, temperature, and composition that are relevant. A review of computational results reported during the last couple of decades shows that essentially all properties including structure, phase transition, equation of state, thermodynamics, elasticity, alloying, conductivity, defects, interfaces, diffusivity, viscosity, and melting have been calculated from first principles. Using MgO, the second most abundant oxide of Earth's mantle, as a primary example and considering many other mantle materials in their crystalline and amorphous phases, we have found that most properties are strongly pressure dependent, sometimes varying non-monotonically and anomalously, with the effects of temperature being systematically suppressed with compression. The overall agreement with the available experimental data is excellent; it is remarkable that the early-calculated results such as shear wave velocities of two key phases, MgO and MgSiO3 perovskite, were subsequently reproduced by experimentation covering almost the entire mantle pressure regime. As covered in some detail, the defect formation and migration enthalpies of key mantle materials increase with pressure. The predicted trend is that partial MgO Schottky defects are energetically most favorable in Mg-silicates but their formation enthalpies are high. So, the diffusion in the mantle is likely to be in the extrinsic regime. Preliminary results on MgO and forsterite hint that the grain boundaries can accommodate point defects (including impurities) and enhance diffusion rates at all pressures. The structures are highly distorted in the close vicinity of the defects and at the interface with excess space. Recent simulations of MgO-SiO2 binary and other silicate melts have found that the melt self-diffusion and viscosity vary by several orders of magnitudes with pressure, temperature, and composition. The predicted high compressibility and complex dynamical behavior can be associated with structural changes (involving non-bridging oxygen, oxygen tri-clusters, Si-O pentahedra, etc.) occurring on compression. We envision future prospect for massively parallel/distributed computing of unprecedented magnitude and scope in the study of relevant materials for Earth, super-Earth, and other planets. A renewed computational theme perhaps should be the first-principles simulations of large systems (with long runs) that are necessary to explore realistic (natural) compositions, polycrystalline phases, multi-component melts, crystal/melt interfaces, trace element partitioning, etc.},

abstract = {Temperature gradients in a low-shear-velocity province in the lowermost mantle (D'' region) beneath the central Pacific Ocean were inferred from the observation of a rapid S-wave velocity increase overlying a rapid decrease. These paired seismic discontinuities are attributed to a phase change from perovskite to post-perovskite and then back to perovskite as the temperature increases with depth. Iron enrichment could explain the occurrence of post-perovskite several hundred kilometers above the core-mantle boundary in this warm, chemically distinct province. The double phase-boundary crossing directly constrains the lowermost mantle temperature gradients. Assuming a standard but unconstrained choice of thermal conductivity, the regional core-mantle boundary heat flux (approximately 85 +/- 25 milliwatts per square meter), comparable to the average at Earth's surface, was estimated, along with a lower bound on global core-mantle boundary heat flow in the range of 13 +/- 4 terawatts. Mapped velocity-contrast variations indicate that the lens of post-perovskite minerals thins and vanishes over 1000 kilometers laterally toward the margin of the chemical distinct region as a result of a approximately 500-kelvin temperature increase.},

Yet, there are no direct experimental measurements of thermal conductivity at relevant pressure–temperature conditions of Earth's core–mantle boundary. Here we determine the radiative conductivity of post-perovskite at near core–mantle boundary conditions by optical absorption measurements in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Our results show that the radiative conductivity of Mg0.9Fe0.1SiO3post-perovskite (∼1.1 W/m/K) is almost two times smaller than that of bridgmanite (∼2.0 W/m/K) at the base of the mantle. By combining this result with the present-day core–mantle heat flow and available estimations on the lattice thermal conductivity we conclude that post-perovskite is at least as abundant as bridgmanite in the lowermost mantle which has profound implications for the dynamics of the deep Earth.},

Consisting primarily of a polycrystalline aggregate of silicate perovskite and ferropericlase, the thermal boundary layer at the very base of Earth's lower mantle regulates the heat flow from the core, so that the thermal conductivity (k) of these mineral phases controls the amount of heat entering the lowermost mantle. Here we report measurements of the lattice thermal conductivity of pure, Al-, and Fe-bearing MgSiO(3) perovskite at 26 GPa up to 1,073 K, and of ferropericlase containing 0, 5, and 20{\%} Fe, at 8 and 14 GPa up to 1,273 K. We find the incorporation of these elements in silicate perovskite and ferropericlase to result in a ∼50{\%} decrease of lattice thermal conductivity relative to the end member compositions. A model of thermal conductivity constrained from our results indicates that a peridotitic mantle would have k = 9.1 ± 1.2 W/m K at the top of the thermal boundary layer and k = 8.4 ± 1.2 W/m K at its base. These values translate into a heat flux of 11.0 ± 1.4 terawatts (TW) from Earth's core, a range of values consistent with a variety of geophysical estimates.},

abstract = {The lower mantle constitutes more than half the Earth's interior by volume, and is believed to consist predominantly of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite with up to approximately 20{\%} (Mg,Fe)O. In the system FeO–MgO–SiO2, iron partitions preferentially into (Mg,Fe)O relative to the perovskite phase and has been believed to be nearly all in the form of Fe2+on the basis of experiments in the MgO–FeO–SiO2 system1, 2, 3, 4. Here, however, we present a M{\"{o}}ssbauer study of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite containing 3.3 mol{\%} Al2O3, which shows that approximately 50{\%} of the iron is Fe3+. These results, combined with evidence from other experiments, suggest that the proportion of iron present as Fe3+in the lower-mantle perovskite phase is probably much higher than is currently believed. Because the oxidation state of iron in the perovskite phase affects the electrostatic charge balance and equilibrium defect concentration, the presence of Fe3+is likely to significantly affect physical and chemical properties of the lower mantle such as sub- and super-solidus phase relations, transport properties, mechanical behaviour, trace-element partitioning and the concentration of species such as hydroxide ions.},

abstract = {We used density functional theory (DFT) to examine the partitioning of ferrous iron between periclase and bridgmanite under lower mantle conditions. To study the effects of the three major variables - pressure, temperature and concentration - these have been varied from 0 to 150 GPa, from 1000 to 4000 K and from 0 to 100{\%} total iron content. We find that increasing temperature increases KD, increasing iron concentration decreases KD, while pressure can both increase and decrease KD. We find that KD decreases slowly from about 0.32 to 0.06 with depth under lower mantle conditions. We also find that KD increases sharply to 0.15 in the very lowermost mantle due to the strong temperature increases near the CMB. Spin transitions have a large effect on the activity of ferropericlase which causes KD to vary with pressure in a peak-like fashion. Despite the apparently large changes in KD through the mantle, this actually results in relatively small changes in total iron content in the two phases, with XFefp ranging from about 0.20 to 0.35, before decreasing again to about 0.28 at the CMB, and XFebd has a pretty constant value of about 0.04-0.07 throughout the lower mantle. For the very high Fe concentrations suggested for ULVZs, Fe partitions very strongly into ferropericlase.},

abstract = {(Mg, Fe)O ferropericlase (Fp) is one of the important minerals comprising Earth's lower mantle, and its thermal conductivity could be strongly influenced by the iron content and its spin state. We examined the lattice thermal conductivity of (Mg, Fe)O Fp containing 19 mol{\%} iron up to 111 GPa and 300 K by means of the pulsed light heating thermoreflectance technique in a diamond anvil cell. We confirmed a strong reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity of Fp due to iron substitution as reported in previous studies. Our results also show that iron spin crossover in Fp reduces its lattice thermal conductivity as well as its radiative conduction. We also measured the electrical conductivity of an identical Fp sample up to 140 GPa and 2730 K, and found that Fp remained an insulator throughout the experimental conditions, indicating the electronic thermal conduction in Fp is negligible. Because of the effects of strong iron impurity scattering and spin crossover, the total thermal conductivity of Fp at the core–mantle boundary conditions is much smaller than that of bridgmanite (Bdg). Our findings indicate that Bdg (and post-perovskite) is the best heat conductor in the Earth's lower mantle, and distribution of iron and its valence state among the lower mantle minerals are key factors to control the lower mantle thermal conductivity.},

abstract = {Bridgmanite (Bdg), iron (Fe)- and aluminum (Al)-bearing magnesium silicate perovskite is the most abundant mineral in the Earth's lower mantle. Thus, its thermal conductivity governs the lower mantle thermal conductivity that critically controls the thermo-chemical evolution of both the core and the lower mantle. While there is extensive research for the lattice thermal conductivity of MgSiO3 Bdg, the effects of Fe and Al incorporation on its lattice thermal conduction are still controversial. Here we report the lattice thermal conductivity of Mg0.832Fe0.209Al0.060Si0.916O3 Bdg measured up to 142 GPa at 300 K using the pulsed light heating thermoreflectance technique in a diamond anvil cell. The results show that the lattice thermal conductivity of Bdg is 25.5±2.2 W/m/K at 135 GPa and 300 K, which is 19{\%} lower than that of Fe and Al-free Bdg at identical conditions. Considering the temperature effect on the lattice conductivity and the contribution of radiative thermal conductivity, the total thermal conductivity of Fe and Al-bearing Bdg does not change very much with temperature at 135 GPa, and could be higher than that of post-perovskite with identical chemical composition.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter–atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently — those with short–range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed–memory parallel machine which allows for message–passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard–Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers—the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y–MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840–node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade–offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. This},

abstract = {The Earth acts as a gigantic heat engine driven by the decay of radiogenic isotopes and slow cooling, which gives rise to plate tectonics, volcanoes and mountain building. Another key product is the geomagnetic field, generated in the liquid iron core by a dynamo running on heat released by cooling and freezing (as the solid inner core grows), and on chemical convection (due to light elements expelled from the liquid on freezing). The power supplied to the geodynamo, measured by the heat flux across the core-mantle boundary (CMB), places constraints on Earth's evolution. Estimates of CMB heat flux depend on properties of iron mixtures under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions in the core, most critically on the thermal and electrical conductivities. These quantities remain poorly known because of inherent experimental and theoretical difficulties. Here we use density functional theory to compute these conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core conditions from first principles-unlike previous estimates, which relied on extrapolations. The mixtures of iron, oxygen, sulphur and silicon are taken from earlier work and fit the seismologically determined core density and inner-core boundary density jump. We find both conductivities to be two to three times higher than estimates in current use. The changes are so large that core thermal histories and power requirements need to be reassessed. New estimates indicate that the adiabatic heat flux is 15 to 16 terawatts at the CMB, higher than present estimates of CMB heat flux based on mantle convection; the top of the core must be thermally stratified and any convection in the upper core must be driven by chemical convection against the adverse thermal buoyancy or lateral variations in CMB heat flow. Power for the geodynamo is greatly restricted, and future models of mantle evolution will need to incorporate a high CMB heat flux and explain the recent formation of the inner core. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Recent seismological discoveries have indicated that the Earth's core - mantle boundary is far more complex than a simple boundary between the molten outer core and the silicate mantle. Instead, its structural complexities probably rival those of the Earth's crust(1). Some regions of the lowermost mantle have been observed to have seismic wave speed reductions of at least 10 per cent(2-7), which appear not to be global in extent(7-9). Here we present robust evidence for an 8.5-km- thick and similar to 50-km-wide pocket of dense, partially molten material at the core - mantle boundary east of Australia. Array analyses of an anomalous precursor to the reflected seismic wave ScP reveal compressional and shear-wave velocity reductions of 8 and 25 per cent, respectively, and a 10 per cent increase in density of the partially molten aggregate. Seismological data are incompatible with a basal layer composed of pure melt, and thus require a mechanism to prevent downward percolation of dense melt within the layer. This may be possible by trapping of melt by cumulus crystal growth following melt drainage from an anomalously hot overlying region of the lowermost mantle. This magmatic evolution and the resulting cumulate structure seem to be associated with overlying thermal instabilities, and thus may mark a root zone of an upwelling plume.},

annote = {DIRECT METHOD
































the direct method of calculating thermal conductivity is analogous to experiment
































particle velocities are altered at each time step to change the kinetic energy, energy and thus heat is added to/taken from the system. 
































a quarter of the way along the cell, heat is added, a quarter from the opposite end heat is removed. this sets up a heat current, resulting in a temperature gradient that can be calculated. fourier's law is used alongside this to calculate the thermal conductivity. 
































an error is created, by the drift of the system's centre of mass. local temperature must be defined using velocities obtained in a system with zero centre of mass velocity.
































*ballistic energy currents
































the direct method calculates the thermal conductivity only in the direction of the heat current. for other directions new calculations and experimental cells must be set up.
































the direct method involves large temperature gradients, well outside of the experimental range. it is not immediately obvious that the direct method results will be consistent with experiment. very large temperature gradients may induce non linear effects around the source and sink, such that fourier's law does not apply.
strong non-linear temperature profiles are observed (in this calculation) around 6nm of the source and sink, which is attributed to scattering caused by heating. outside of these regions, temperatures can be fit with a linear profile. two profiles are fit (across the cell and over the boundary) and used to create an error estimate for the thermal conductivity.
































* infinite system extrapolation
an important feature of the simulation cell is the boundaries around the edges of the source and sink. the atomic dynamics in the slabs are altered by the simulation, causing the mean free path to be limited by the size of the system (casimir limit). however, finite size analysis on smaller systems means it is possible to get a good estimate for an infinte system.
































the direct method requires that steady state flow be achieved, a stationary temperature profile as a function of time. only when steady-state currents are flowing can thermal conductivity be calculated from fourier's law. for a limited number of time steps, temperature fluctuations are statistical, but on longer timescales transient effects (relating to the establishment of steady state thermal current) can be observed.
































to check that fourier's law is obeyed and that nonlinear effects are unimportant, it is necessary to check that the computed TC does not depend on the heat of the system. this study found TC to vary with heat, for both extremes. small heats result in large TC error bars, because the magnitude of temperature difference across the cell can be similar to the statistical noise. large values are unsuitable as they create non linear effects. a range of heats are tested, and the one with the smallest error bars are chosen going forwards.
































finite size effects arise when the cell is not significantly longer than the phonon mean free path. this is caused by scattering effects that occur at the interfaces with the source/sink. thermal conductivity is limited by the system size, when the system size is smaller than the mean-free path in an infinite system (casimir).
































*ballistic phono transport / solitonlike modes
































TC does depend on the dimensions to current flow, but not by much. smaller cross-sectional areas produce larger TCs for equivalent current densities. TC from a 2x2xN system compared to a 4x4xN system will be at most 20{\%} larger, and systems larger than 3x3xN agree within error},

abstract = {A systematic method to calculate anharmonic force constants of crystals is presented. The method employs the direct-method approach, where anharmonic force constants are extracted from the trajectory of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at high temperature. The method is applied to Si where accurate cubic and quartic force constants are obtained. We observe that higher-order correction is crucial to obtain accurate force constants from the trajectory with large atomic displacements. The calculated harmonic and anharmonic force constants are, then, combined with the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods in calculating the thermal conductivity. The BTE approach successfully predicts the lattice thermal conductivity of bulk Si, whereas NEMD shows considerable underestimates. To evaluate the linear extrapolation method employed in NEMD to estimate bulk values, we analyze the size dependence in NEMD based on BTE calculations. We observe strong nonlinearity in the size dependence of NEMD in Si, which can be ascribed to acoustic phonons having long mean-free-paths and carrying considerable heat. Subsequently, we also apply the whole method to a thermoelectric material Mg2Si and demonstrate the reliability of the NEMD method for systems with low thermal conductivities.},

abstract = {Thermal conductivity of the Earth's lower mantle greatly impacts the mantle convection style and affects the heat conduction from the core to the mantle. Direct laboratory measurement of thermal conductivity of mantle minerals remains a technical challenge at the pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions relevant to the lower mantle, and previously estimated values are extrapolated from low P-T data based on simple empirical thermal transport models. By using a numerical technique that combines first-principles electronic structure theory and Peierls-Boltzmann transport theory, we predict the lattice thermal conductivity of MgO, previously used to estimate the thermal conductivity in the Earth, at conditions from ambient to the core-mantle boundary (CMB). We show that our first-principles technique provides a realistic model for the P-T dependence of lattice thermal conductivity of MgO at conditions from ambient to the CMB, and we propose thermal conductivity profiles of MgO in the lower mantle based on geotherm models. The calculated conductivity increases from 15 -20 W/K-m at the 670 km seismic discontinuity to 40 -50 W/K-m at the CMB. This large depth variation in calculated thermal conductivity should be included in models of mantle convection, which has been traditionally studied based on the assumption of constant conductivity.},

abstract = {The thermal conductivities of empty and water-filled single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with diameters between 0.83 and 1.36 nm and lengths ranging from 200 to 1400 nm are predicted using molecular dynamics simulation. Using a direct application of the Fourier law, we explore the transition to fully diffusive phonon transport with increasing CNT length. For empty CNTs, we find that the CNT length required to obtain fully diffusive phonon transport decreases from 1090 nm for the 0.83-nm-diameter CNT to 510 nm for the 1.36-nm-diameter CNT. The magnitude of the fully diffusive thermal conductivity also decreases monotonically with increasing CNT diameter. We find that the fully diffusive thermal conductivity of water-filled CNTs is 20{\%}–35{\%} lower than that of empty CNTs. By examining the empty and water-filled CNT density of states, we attribute the thermal conductivity reductions to an increase in low-frequency acoustic phonon scattering due to interactions with the water molecules.},

abstract = {In numerical simulations of mantle convection it is commonly assumed that the coefficients of thermal expansion $\alpha$ and thermal conduction k are either constant or pressure-dependent. Pressure changes are generally computed using parametrizations that rely on extrapolations of low-pressure data for a single upper-mantle phase. Here we collect data for both the pressure and temperature dependence of $\alpha$ from a database of first-principles calculations, and of k from recent experimental studies. We use these data-sets to construct analytical parametrizations of $\alpha$ and k for the major upper- and lower-mantle phases that can be easily incorporated into exisiting convection codes. We then analyze the impact of such parametrizations on Earth's mantle dynamics by employing two-dimensional numerical models of thermal convection. When $\alpha$ is the only variable parameter, both its temperature and pressure dependence enhance hot plumes and tend to inhibit the descent of cold downwellings. Taking into account a variable k leads to a strong increase of the bulk mantle temperature, which reduces the buoyancy available to amplify bottom boundary layer instabilities and causes mantle flow to be driven primarily by the instability of cold plates whose surface velocity also tends to rise. When both parameters are considered together, we observe an increased propensity to local layering which favors slab stagnation in the transition zone and subsequent thickening in the lower mantle. Furthermore, the values of k near the core-mantle boundary ultimately control the effect of this physical property on convection, which stresses the importance of determining the thermal conductivity of the post-perovskite phase. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The 2004-discovery of the post-perovskite transition initiated a vigorous effort in high-pressure, high-temperature mineralogy and mineral physics, seismology and geodynamics aimed at an improved understanding of the structure and dynamics of the D ''-zone. The phase transitions in basaltic and peridotitic lithologies under pT-conditions of the lowermost mantle can explain a series of previously enigmatic seismic discontinuities. Some of the other seismic properties of the lowermost mantle are also consistent with the changes in physical properties related to the perovskite (pv) to post-perovskite (ppv) transition. After more than 25 years of seismic tomography, the lowermost mantle structure involving the sub-Pacific and sub-African Large Low Shear-Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) has become a robust feature. The two large antipodal LLSVPs are surrounded by wide zones of high Vs under the regions characterized by Mesozoic to recent subduction. The D '' is further characterized by a negative correlation between shear and bulk sound velocity which could be partly related to an uneven distribution of pv and ppv. Ppv has higher VS and lower V(Phi) (bulk sound speed) than pv and may be present in thicker layers in the colder regions of D ''. Seismic observations and geodynamic modelling indicate relatively steep and sharp boundaries of the 200-500 km thick LLSVPs. These features, as well as independent evidence for their long-term stability, indicate that they are intrinsically denser than the surrounding mantle. Mineral physics data demonstrate that basaltic lithologies are denser than peridotite throughout the lowermost mantle and undergo incremental densification due to the pvppv-transition at slightly shallower levels than peridotite. The density contrasts may facilitate the partial separation and accumulation of basaltic patches and slivers at the margins of the thermochemical piles (LLSVPs). The slopes of these relatively steep margins towards the adjacent horizontal core-mantle boundary (CMB) constitute a curved (concave) thermal boundary layer, favourable for the episodic generation of large mantle plumes. Reconstruction of the original positions of large igneous provinces formed during the last 300 Ma, using a paleomagnetic global reference frame, indicates that nearly all of them erupted above the margins of the LLSVPs. Fe/Mg-partitioning between pv, ppv and ferropericlase (fp) is important for the phase and density relations of the lower mantle. Electronic spin transition of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the different phases may influence the Fe/Mg-partitioning and the radiative thermal conductivity in the lowermost mantle. The experimental determination of the K(Dpv/fp)(Fe/Mg) [= (Fc/Mg)(pv)/(Fc/Mg)(fp)] K(Dppv/fp)(Fe/ Mg) is technologically challenging. Most studies have found a K(Dpv/fp)(Fe/ Mg) of 0.1-0.3 and a higher Fe/Mg-ratio in ppv than in pv. The experimental temperature is important, with the partitioning approaching unity with increasing temperature. Although charge-coupled substitutions of the trivalent cations Al and Fe3+ seem to be important in both pv and ppv (especially in basaltic compositions), the complicating crystal-chemistry effects of these cations are not fully clarified. The two anti-podal thermochemical piles as well as the thin ultra-low velocity zones next to the CMB may represent geochemically enriched reservoirs that have remained largely isolated from the convecting mantle through a major part of Earth history. The eistence of such " hidden" reservoirs have previously been suggested in order to account for the imbalance between the inferred composition of the geochemically accessible convecting mantle and the observed heat flow from the Earth and chondritic models for the bulk Earth.},

abstract = {Two methods for predicting phonon frequencies and relaxation times are presented. The first is based on quasiharmonic and anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations, and the second is based on a combination of quasiharmonic lattice dynamics calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. These phonon properties are then used with the Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation-time approximation to predict the lattice thermal conductivity. The validity of the low-temperature assumptions made in the lattice dynamics framework are assessed by comparing to thermal conductivities predicted by the Green-Kubo and direct molecular dynamics methods for a test system of Lennard-Jones argon. The predictions of all four methods are in agreement at low temperature (20 K). At temperatures of 40 K (half the Debye temperature of Lennard-Jones argon) and below, the thermal-conductivity predictions from the two methods that use lattice dynamics calculations are within about 30{\%} of those made using the more accurate Green-Kubo and direct molecular dynamics methods. The thermal-conductivity predictions using the lattice dynamics techniques become inaccurate at high temperature (above 40 K) due to the approximations inherent in the lattice dynamics framework. We apply the results to assess the validity of (i) the isotropic approximation in modeling thermal transport and (ii) the common assertion that low-frequency phonons dominate thermal transport. Lastly, we suggest approximations that can be made within the lattice dynamics framework that allow the thermal conductivity of Lennard-Jones argon to be estimated using two orders of magnitude less computing effort than the Green-Kubo or direct molecular dynamics methods.},
